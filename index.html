	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> Hello! My name is Joren Jacobs and I welcome you to my personal website! Please feel free to take a look around and explore what I might have to offer you! </p>
	  <p></p>
	  <h3>My hakuna matata</h3>
	  <p>No matter how big or small. Everyone has his/her/... story. I believe that ,although you can't choose your obstacles, you CAN choose how you react. The values you show in harder situations are the things which define you as a "warrior". </p>
	  <p> To be fair: I can't wait to see what fate has in store for us. I am 100% confident I will make the best of every situation laid before me! </p>
	  <p></p>
	  <h3>My story is your story </h3>
	  <p>As a person ,who likes to think that "he knows what he wants", I also certainly know what I don't want. I want to build. I believe in both the strength of an individual as well as the power through teamwork! I'm definetly not shy to team up with like-minded people. The goal is to build the world around us and improve our own invidual skills and personality in the process!</p>
	  <p> </p>
	  <h3> What is this actually website for?</h3>
	  <p> With the power of HTML, CSS and Javascript I enthousiasticly created this online hub for people to get to know me better in a rather professional way. I'm aware there are many third party sites like WIX etc. But this is my personal way of profilizing myself on the wide web. Almost like a CV so I'm eager to showcase my HTML & CSS skillset! Let me know if you like this, in the destinated section! If you'd like to work with me, don't hestitate of using the "contact" page. Who knows, maybe a "future us" might be working together?! </p>
