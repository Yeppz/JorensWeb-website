	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> Hello! My name is Joren Jacobs and I welcome you to my personal website! Please feel free to take a look around and explore what I might have to offer you! </p>
	  <p></p>
	  <h3>My hakuna matata</h3>
	  <p>No matter how big or small. Everyone has his/her/... story. When I was younger I thought "I was made to fail". Nowadays I know that nothing is less true! </p>
	  <p> I can't wait to see what fate has in store for us.I am 100% confident I will make the best of every situation laid before me! For we , as humans, have one true superpower: the power of choice! </p>
	  <p></p>
	  <h3>My story is your story </h3>
	  <p>As a person who likes to think that he knows what he wants, I also certainly know what I don't want. I want to build. I believe in both the strength of an individual as well as the power through teamwork! I'm definetly not shy to team up with like-minded people. The goal is to build the world around us and improve our own invidual skills and personality in the process!</p>
	  <p> </p>
	  <h3> What is this actually website for?</h3>
	  <p> With the power of HTML, CSS and Javascript I enthousiasticly created this online hub for people to get to know me better in a rather professional way. One of my many motivations is to inspire and be inspired. This is my personal way of profilizing myself on the wide web.("Tinder wasn't quite the right platform for this kind of social engagement ;)") I'd love to hear any feedback you might have for me in the destinated section! If you would like to work with me, don't hestitate of using the "contact" page. Who knows, maybe a future us will be working together?! </p>
